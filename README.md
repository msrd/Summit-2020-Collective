# Summit-2020-Collective
## RD Collective

Have you ever wanted to have more of a say in how the RD program engages with Microsoft and beyond?  Do you have a great idea for an RD roundtable series, mentorship program, online content series, or something of the like but need some help getting your idea off the ground?  Are you looking for an opportunity to collaborate and ideate with other RDs?  

## How to get started: 

Use GitHub "Issues" to propose topics and build out your team.  To propose an idea you would either like present on or that you would like to collaborate with others on, add an "Issue" to this GitHub repo by 5:00PM PST on Friday, March 6.  

Once you form your team, work together to draft a more detailed project title and abstract and submit on Friday, March 13.   

We will anonymize project titles and abstracts and repost to the GitHub repo for group voting.  Voting will begin Saturday, March 14, the ideas with the most thumbs-ups by 12:00PM PDT on Thursday, March 19 will present their idea to the judges and fellow RDs at the RD Collective on Friday, March 20.
