# Summit-2020-Collective
RD Collective 

Have you ever wanted to have more of a say in how the RD program engages with Microsoft and beyond?  Do you have a great idea for an RD roundtable series, mentorship program, online content series, or something of the like but need some help getting your idea off the ground?  Are you looking for an opportunity to collaborate and ideate with other RDs?  If so, read on! 

We are excited to announce that in addition to unconference sessions at RD Summit on Friday, March 20 we will introduce a new segment called RD Collective.  The goals of RD Collective are to give you a platform to share your idea(s) for how the RD program can better harness the talents of the RD community to deliver more value to Microsoft and beyond and provide the support you need to get this idea going. 

So, how will RD Collective work?   

Share ideas and team up.  Post your early project ideas or join forces with other RDs to collaborate on theirs.  We want this to be a group effort, so building teams and branching out to refine and perfect your idea is highly encouraged! 

Submit your proposal.  Work as a team to draft a more formal project title and abstract.  Give your project a name and a 100 – 200-word description of what it is and its objective.  Since the idea is that some project proposals will be presented live at RD Summit, all teams must have at least one member who will be present at RD Summit on March 20. 

Vote for your favorite(s).  We will anonymize and post the project proposals on GitHub.  This is your chance to vote for your favorite idea(s)!  Everyone is welcome to vote regardless of whether you will be attending RD Summit or not! The teams whose idea receive the most votes will be invited to present their idea in person at RD Summit. 

Work on a presentation.  We won’t know until the day before who will be invited to present their idea on-site at RD Summit, but all teams should be prepared with a presentation of sorts.  Maybe your idea would be best communicated through a PowerPoint, a video clip, or a prototype – there are no boundaries, be creative! 

Pitch your idea to the judges.  That’s right, the idea with the most votes will be invited to deliver their project presentation to a panel of Microsoft judges!  The judges will select one winning project to be incorporated into the RD program planning cycle for the next fiscal year.  The winning team may qualify for logistics and financial support provided by Microsoft. 

How to get started: 

Use GitHub "Issues" to propose topics and build out your team.  To propose an idea you would either like present on or that you would like to collaborate with others on, add an "Issue" to this GitHub repo by 5:00PM PST on Friday, March 6.  

Once you form your team, work together to draft a more detailed project title and abstract and submit on Friday, March 13.   

We will anonymize project titles and abstracts and repost to the GitHub repo for group voting.  Voting will begin Saturday, March 14, the ideas with the most thumbs-ups by 12:00PM PDT on Thursday, March 19 will present their idea to the judges and fellow RDs at the RD Collective on Friday, March 20.
